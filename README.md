# InstaCart Analysis

As an analyst at Instacart, I'm delving deep into their sales data to unveil concealed patterns. My objective is to enhance their market segmentation strategies through comprehensive exploratory analysis using Python. Keep an eye out for insights that may reshape their tactics and lead to improved sales outcomes.

# Instacart Data Analysis Project
## Objective
Instacart, a leading online grocery platform, is on a quest to optimize its marketing strategies. Recognizing the limitations of a uniform approach, they seek to refine their tactics for different customer segments. My analysis is geared towards effectively segmenting customers and recommending targeted strategies to boost product sales.


## Key Questions

Here are the questions broken down with each bullet point:

1. **Peak Order Times and Days**:
   - Determining the peak times and days when orders are placed the most frequently.
   - Analyzing order timestamps to identify patterns of high activity.
   - This information can guide resource allocation, staffing, and promotional timing.

2. **Customer Spending Habits**:
   - Examining when customers tend to make larger purchases or spend more.
   - Utilizing transaction data to identify trends in spending behavior.
   - Insights can inform targeted promotions or incentives during peak spending periods.

3. **Impact of Product Price Ranges**:
   - Investigating how different price ranges influence customer purchasing decisions.
   - Analyzing sales data across various price categories to identify trends.
   - Adjusting pricing strategies or offering discounts based on customer preferences can enhance marketing effectiveness.

4. **Popular Product Departments**:
   - Identifying which departments or categories of products are most frequently purchased.
   - Analyzing sales volumes and frequency across different product departments.
   - Tailoring marketing campaigns and promotions to highlight popular departments can drive sales.

5. **Customer Demographics and Behaviors**:
   - Exploring variations in brand loyalty among different demographic groups.
   - Analyzing regional differences in purchasing patterns and product preferences.
   - Examining customer behavior such as repeat purchases, basket size, and product affinities.
   - These insights can inform targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and localized promotions to better resonate with diverse customer segments.

By addressing these questions through data analysis and insights generation, Instacart can refine its marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and ultimately drive sales growth.


## Data Source

The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.
The dataset includes information on orders, products, customers, and departments.
Additionally, a customer dataset with the column 'prices' was appended to the original dataset for educational purposes within the Career Foundry course.

## Tools:

- Python was utilized for data analysis, employing various libraries including Pandas for data analysis, Numpy for mathematical operations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization, and SciPy for mathematical computations.

## Folders:

- Project files are organized into different folders:
  - 01 Project Management: Consists of the Project Brief and Data Dictionary.
  - 02 Data: Subdivided into Original and Prepared Data subfolders, housing the initial datasets and the cleaned and preprocessed datasets, respectively. (Due to size constraints, data files were not uploaded to GitHub.)
  - 03 Scripts: Contains Jupyter notebooks containing code for analysis.
  - 04 Analysis: Further divided into Reports and Visualizations subfolders. Reports encompass crosstabs, while Visualizations contain graphical representations utilized for uncovering and elucidating insights.
  - 05 Sent to Client: This folder holds the final report, presented in Excel format.

## Resources:

- Note: The dataset utilized for analysis is sourced from Instacart, a real company that has made its data publicly accessible online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by CareerFoundry exclusively for the purposes of this analysis.


## Final Deliverable

For a comprehensive view of my findings and recommendations look for my files containing all datasets, graphs, and reports.

This analysis goes beyond uncovering current trends; it also involves predicting future customer behaviors. By doing so, Instacart can proactively adapt its strategies to stay ahead in a competitive market landscape.
